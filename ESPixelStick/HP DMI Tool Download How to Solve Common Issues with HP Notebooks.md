## Step 2: Create a DOS Bootable Disk
  
HP DMI Tool only works in DOS mode, so you need to create a DOS bootable disk to run it. You can use a USB flash drive or a CD/DVD for this purpose. To create a DOS bootable disk, you need a software such as Rufus or UNetbootin. You can download Rufus from here: https://rufus.ie/ or UNetbootin from here: https://unetbootin.github.io/.
  
After downloading the software, follow these steps to create a DOS bootable disk:
  
- Insert your USB flash drive or CD/DVD into your computer.
- Open Rufus or UNetbootin and select your device from the list.
- Select "FreeDOS" as the boot selection or distribution.
- Click on "Start" or "OK" to begin the process.
- Wait until the process is completed and then close the software.
- Copy the HP DMI Tool executable file (HPBQ138.exe) from the zip file to your DOS bootable disk.

## Step 3: Run HP DMI Tool
  
Now that you have created a DOS bootable disk with HP DMI Tool, you need to run it on your HP device. Follow these steps to do so:

- Turn off your HP device and disconnect it from any power source.
- Insert your DOS bootable disk into your HP device.
- Turn on your HP device and press F9 or Esc repeatedly to enter the boot menu.
- Select your DOS bootable disk from the list and press Enter.
- You will see a command prompt window with a blinking cursor.
- Type "HPBQ138.exe" and press Enter to run HP DMI Tool.
- You will see a menu with several options. Select "Notebook Model Information" and press Enter.
- You will see a list of product information fields that you need to fill in. Use the arrow keys and Enter key to navigate and edit them. You can find some of the information on the label at the bottom of your device or on the original packaging. If you are not sure about some fields, leave them blank or use default values.
- After filling in all the fields, press F10 to save and exit.
- You will see a confirmation message saying "DMI Update Success". Press any key to continue.
- Eject your DOS bootable disk and restart your HP device.
