# How to Change Your FOV in Black Ops 2 on PC
 
If you are playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 on PC, you might want to change your field of view (FOV) to get a better view of the action. FOV is the angle of your vision that you can see on the screen. A higher FOV means you can see more of your surroundings, while a lower FOV means you can see less but with more detail.
 
Unfortunately, Black Ops 2 does not have an official option to change your FOV in the game settings. The default FOV is 65, which is quite low for a PC game. However, there are some ways to change your FOV using third-party tools or console commands.

## Using a FOV Changer Tool
 
One of the easiest ways to change your FOV in Black Ops 2 is to use a FOV changer tool.

5. Press F1 again to close the menu and enjoy your new FOV.

## Using Console Commands
 
Another way to change your FOV in Black Ops 2 is to use console commands. This is a more advanced method that requires you to edit some game files and enter some codes in the game console. To use this method, you need to follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your Black Ops 2 installation folder and open the "player" folder.
2. Create a backup copy of the "config.cfg" file and open it with a text editor.
3. Find the line that says "seta cg\_fov \"65\"" and change the value to whatever you want. The maximum value is 80.
4. Save and close the file.
5. Launch the game and press the tilde key (~) to open the console.
6. Type "/cg\_fovscale X" where X is a number between 1 and 1.39. This will scale your FOV by a factor of X. For example, if you set your FOV to 80 in the config file and type "/cg\_fovscale 1.39" in the console, your effective FOV will be about 111.
7. Press enter and enjoy your new FOV.

Note that this method works for all modes, but you need to enter the console command every time you launch the game or change maps. Also, be aware that changing your FOV too much might cause some graphical glitches or performance issues.
