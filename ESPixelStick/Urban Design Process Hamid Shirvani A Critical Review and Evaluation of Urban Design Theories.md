Another strength of the book is its global and comparative perspective on urban design. The book exposes the readers to a variety of urban design projects from different parts of the world, highlighting the similarities and differences in their contexts, objectives, challenges, and outcomes. The book also provides insights into the cultural, social, political, and economic factors that influence urban design practices and preferences in different regions and countries. The book helps the readers to appreciate the diversity and complexity of urban design as a global phenomenon that reflects and affects local realities and aspirations.
 
A possible limitation of the book is its lack of focus on some emerging issues and trends in urban design, such as digital technologies, smart cities, participatory design, resilience, and social justice. The book does not address how these issues and trends affect or challenge the existing theories and methods of urban design, or how they create new opportunities and possibilities for urban design innovation and experimentation. The book could benefit from incorporating more recent examples and discussions of urban design projects that respond to these issues and trends, or that propose alternative or radical visions for the future of cities.
