We want to make your visit as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. That's why we offer a range of accessibility services and accommodations for visitors with disabilities. You can find designated accessible parking spaces near the museum entrance, which is also barrier-free and has automatic doors. Inside the museum, you can use our accessible restrooms, borrow a wheelchair or a walker, request a sign language interpreter, and more. If you have any questions or special requests, please don't hesitate to contact us at AccessProg@philamuseum.org. We're happy to help. You can also view more information about our accessibility services on our website.
