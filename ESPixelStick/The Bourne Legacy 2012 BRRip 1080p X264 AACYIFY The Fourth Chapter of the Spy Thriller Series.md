The Bourne Legacy 2012 is not a direct sequel to the previous Bourne movies, but rather a spin-off that explores a different aspect of the same world. It introduces a new program called Outcome, which is similar to Treadstone but more advanced and secretive. Outcome agents are genetically modified to enhance their physical and mental abilities, making them superhuman. However, when Jason Bourne exposes Treadstone and Blackbriar in The Bourne Ultimatum, the CIA decides to shut down Outcome and eliminate all its agents.
 
Aaron Cross is one of the surviving Outcome agents who manages to escape the CIA's assassination attempt. He suffers from withdrawal symptoms as he runs out of the pills that maintain his enhancements. He tracks down Dr. Marta Shearing, the only person who can help him get more pills and find a permanent solution. Dr. Shearing is also in danger, as she witnessed the murder of her colleagues by another Outcome agent who went rogue. Together, they flee from the CIA and travel to Manila, where they hope to find a way to free themselves from Outcome's control.
