The serial number of your LEER cap is usually located on a sticker inside the cap, on the driver's side. The sticker may be on the ceiling, the wall, or the rear door of the cap. It should have a barcode and a series of numbers and letters. The serial number is the last six digits of this code.
 
If you can't find the sticker inside your cap, you can also look for it on the outside of the cap, on the passenger's side. There may be a small metal plate with the serial number engraved on it, near the bottom edge of the cap. You may need to lift the tailgate of your truck to see it.
